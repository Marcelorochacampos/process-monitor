# Process monitor

A linux process monitor made with cpp for the Udacity nanodegree course

## ncurses
[ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) is a library that facilitates text-based graphical output in the terminal. This project relies on ncurses for display output.

It will be needed to install ncurses within your own Linux environment: `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

## Make
This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Instructions

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/Marcelorochacampos/process-monitor.git`

2. Create the build folder: `mkdir build && cd build`

3. Build the project:
```
cmake ..
make
```

4. Run the resulting executable: `./monitor`
